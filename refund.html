            <p>Hi-Res Prime is committed to customer satisfaction. However, due to the nature of digital goods, our refund policy is as follows:</p>

            <h2>1. Per-Track Purchases</h2>
            <p>All individual track purchases are considered **final** and **non-refundable**. Once a digital track is downloaded, it is impossible to return it. We encourage you to use the preview feature before making a purchase.</p>

            <h2>2. Subscription Plans</h2>
            <p>We do not offer refunds for subscription fees. You may cancel your subscription at any time, and you will retain access to the service until the end of your current billing period. No further charges will be applied after cancellation.</p>

            <h2>3. Exceptions</h2>
            <p>In the event of a technical issue that prevents you from accessing or downloading a purchased track, we will investigate the issue. If the problem is determined to be on our end, we will provide a full refund or a replacement of the digital good.</p>
